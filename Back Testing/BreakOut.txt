IntraDay Trading Stratergy 
Technical Indicator Needed:
- ATR {max(high-low,high-prevclose,low-prevclose)}

KPI Needed:
- CAGR {((ending_value/begining_value)^1/n)-1}
- MAX Draw Drown {Difference Betwwen Highest High Followed By Lowest Low}
- Volatilty(Annualised) {STD of CAGR * root(n)}
- Sharpe {(cagr-riskfreerate/volatility)}

Algo:
Step 1:- Caluclate rolling max closed price,rolling min closed price,rolling max volume.
Step 2.1:- If there is no signal add 0 to returns for that candle of ticker
   2.1.1:- Checking price breakout i.e. If high price of that candle is greater than equal to roll max price & 
	   Checking volume breakout i.e If current volume is greater than 1.5 times of prev roll max volume
	   then Buy
   2.1.2:- Checking price breakout i.e. If low price of that candle is less than equal to roll min price & 
	   Checking volume breakout i.e If current volume is greater than 1.5 times of prev roll max volume
	   then Sell
Step 2.2:- If there is buy signal of ticker 
   2.2.1:- Checking for trailing stop loss i.e. If low price of that candle is smaller prev close price - prev atr 
	   then change Buy signal to no signal/NULL signal 
	   Calculate and store return, return = stop loss point i.e. (prev close price - prev atr), 
           now (divide return by prev close)-1 to get return perctange 
   2.2.2:- Checking if reversal is triggered i.e. If low price of that candle is less than equal to roll min price & 
	   Checking volume breakout i.e If current volume is greater than 1.5 times of prev roll max volume
	   then change Buy signal to Sell signal &
           Calculate and store return, return perctange = (curr close price/prev close price)-1 
   2.2.3:- If both conditions fails Calculate and store return, return perctange = (curr close price/prev close price)-1 

Step 2.3:- If there is Sell signal of ticker 
   2.3.1:- Checking for take profit order i.e. If high price of that candle is greater prev close price + prev atr 
	   then change Sell signal to no signal/NULL signal 
	   Calculate and store return, return = stop loss poit i.e. (prev close price - prev atr), 
           now (divide prev close by return)-1 to get return perctange 
   2.3.2:- Checking if reversal is triggered i.e. If high price of that candle is greater than equal to roll max price & 
	   Checking volume breakout i.e If current volume is greater than 1.5 times of prev roll max volume
	   then change Sell signal to Buy signal &
	   Calculate and store return, return perctange = (prev close price/curr close)-1 
   2.3.3:- If both conditions fails Calculate and store return, return perctange = (prev close price/curr close price)-1
